## Overview
### Description
This app is a simple recreation of the Twitter interface and offers the same functionalities as the real Twitter platform. With this app, you can view a number of tweets and interact with them by liking, retweeting, viewing comments and even creating new tweets. The app has been built using Vanilla JavaScript, making it lightweight and easy to understand.

## Features 
- Like tweets
- Retweet tweets
- View comments
- Create new tweets

The interface consists of a list of tweets, each tweet displaying the username, the content of the tweet, the number of likes, retweets, and comments.

The user can like a tweet by clicking the heart icon next to it. The number of likes for that tweet will increase by one. The user can also retweet a tweet by clicking the retweet icon. 

The user can view comments for a tweet by clicking on the comment icon. This will bring up a list of comments for that tweet. 

Finally, the user can create a new tweet by clicking on the "Tweet" button and entering the tweet in the text area.

## How to run the project
To use this Twitter clone, you need to run it on a live server. This is because the script tag in the index.html file has its type set to "module". Opening the index.html file directly in a web browser won't work.
